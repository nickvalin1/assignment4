<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use basic math skills to defeat an alien invasion.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The four year old player should have an educational experience by practicing his or her math skills to win a video game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Educational action game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move left and right with the left and right arrows. The player can jump while on the ground with the up arrow and fastfall while in the air with the down arrow. The player can wall jump by pressing the opposite direction of the wall he or she is pressing against while in the air. A wall jump is half the size of a regular jump. When the player collides with an alien, he or she is prompted to complete a simple math problem that must be answered correctly to continue.    
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the walljump mechanic and getting user input. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Use math to defeat your enemies while navigating the caves using walljumps. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Since the beginning of their species, the four dimensional Tralfamadorians have known about all events that have ever occurred and will ever occur and can move through these events as a three dimensional being would move through a room. As such, the current invasion by the three dimensional xenomorphs came as no surprise. Being pacifists, the Tralfamadorians choosing to inhabit this point in time must defeat the xenomorphs with their brains rather than brawn.   
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Your home planet of Tralfamadore is being invaded by the vicious xenomorphs. They are currently contained to the caves below the capital city, but you must use your math skills to defeat them before they can reach the surface of Tralfamadore!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A four year old that loves space and aliens and could use some math practice. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1-2 minutes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Approach the aliens systematically, defeating the ones closest to you before moving on to avoid having to double back. Only walljump when necessary to progress, because it can make movement more difficult. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
alien.wav and jump.wav from soundbible.com, starman.m4a is Starman by David Bowie from my personal music library, the tileset is from opengameart.org, dude.png from relaxate.com, alien.gif from spriters-resource.com
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game is inspired by Math Blaster, a game I played as a child that required the player to solve math problems to progress through the game.
